# ScreepsBot by Emil Merle
This is a small repository for my own Screeps bot where I will share my progress.
Feel free to try it out and/ or make suggestions what to add or to update.

## folders
The [default folder](https://github.com/emilmerle/screepsBot/tree/master/default) is the folder that I'm using for the real game in the persistent world. 
I use the [scripts folder](https://github.com/emilmerle/screepsBot/tree/master/scripts) for any scripts or tests that I use in the offline simulation.
